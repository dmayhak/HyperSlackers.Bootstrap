HyperSlackers.Bootstrap
=======================

Fluent API for using Bootstrap 3 in MVC applications.

I've been working on a bunch of Bootstrap helper methods for quite a while before discovering Dmitry Efimenko's 
excellent work. I have since merged my code base with his to create this derivative work. Dmitry's open source
TwitterBootstrapMVC (for Bootstrap 2) can be found here: https://github.com/DmitryEfimenko/TwitterBootstrapMvc. 
If you are using Bootstrap 2, it is the way to go.
